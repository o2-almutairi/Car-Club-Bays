# Implementation

## Introduction
The system is implemented using MySQL, Node.js 16 version and javascript. The development of node module is a known issue.
It is very important to start the node.js application and install the dependencies of the project.

## Project Structure
provide a table listing the number of jslint warnings/reports for each module.
The node application has many files and folders in it when a project is created. We may ignore node_modules because it contains
the installed modules only. The short Description of other components of the are described breifly in this section.

Starting from Application Main Folder:
### app.js
This file contains the complete settings of the different required modules and ensures that the structure of the application is
properly managed.
### database.js
This file contains the code to connect wit the database server. It works as a bridge between the database server and the application server.
### package.js and package-lock.js
These files contain necessary settings of the application
